For our project, we are going to design our system using a use case driven development.

For the first iteration we will implement the basic use case of adding/deleting an event from the schedule,
without taking into account time collisions or recurring events.

For this use case the user will request an event addition/deletion to the principal.
These requests will then be added to an array which the principle can access and 
then make the required changes to the schedule.
